# Kanban Board App

## Overview
I’ve just completed building an **interactive Kanban board** application using **React JS**. The app fetches data from the provided API and allows users to group tickets by **Status**, **User**, or **Priority**. It also includes sorting options by **Priority** and **Title**, making it easy to organize and view tasks.

The UI is fully responsive and closely matches the provided design, with a clean layout and intuitive card-based structure. I’ve made sure the user’s view preferences are saved even after a page reload. I also stuck to the requirement of using **pure CSS** for styling, avoiding external libraries like Bootstrap or Tailwind to ensure full control over the design.

In terms of functionality, the application seamlessly handles the dynamic grouping and sorting of tickets, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience.
